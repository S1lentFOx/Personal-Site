    <h1> Seems nice website 
         What about paragraph?</h1>
   <h1> And what about this?

        So i see delay, which longs for a seconds or even minutes. Il try check, how long time need be expiried before saved index.html 
        start show any difference in text (text in body block)
        I refreshed page after saving index.html (maybe for 5 seconds nearly) and found no delay. Interesting, am i mistaken before, when 
        indicated some delay? </h1>
   <h1>  No. I was righh. There is some delay. Now it was nearly 30 seconds or more. Not sure where from it comes, maybe github database
        refreshing every minute at constant time, or something like this.</h1>
