    <h1> Seems nice website 
         What about paragraph?</h1>
   <h1> And what about this?

        So i see delay, which longs for a seconds or even minutes. Il try check, how long time need be expiried before saved index.html 
        start show any difference in text (text in body block)
        I refreshed page after saving index.html (maybe for 5 seconds nearly) and found no delay. Interesting, am i mistaken before, when 
        indicated some delay? </h1>
